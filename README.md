# VacationDotNet

**VacationDotNet** is a web-based vacation planning app built using ASP.NET Web Forms.

The app allows users to:
- Chat with an AI assistant to get vacation ideas and plan trips
- View travel recommendations using the Amadeus API
- Get live temperature details for selected locations
- Check currency conversion rates between countries
- Input travel details manually (origin, destination, dates)
- View a list of available flight options to the selected destination

There are two types of users:
- **Regular users** can use all features and optionally create an account to save and view their past searches
- **Admin users** can access a secure Admin page to view all users, see API usage per user, and manage user roles

Login is optional. All features are available to guests, but logging in enables search history tracking.
